#Insight Data Engineering Coding Challenge 
##Scalable Wordcount and Running Median



###Results
####Computing Platform
The implementation was tested on Intel® Core™2 Duo CPU E7500 @ 2.93GHz (Dual Core), 4 GB RAM, Intel G41 Built Display Card, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit.
####Test Data 
####Perfromance
#####Wordcount    
-The sequential implementation of my wordcount algorithm finished in about 3.15 seconds while the multiprocessing implementation finished in about 1.15 second.     
-This enhancement in the performance of is a factor of 2.74    
 #####Running medians
