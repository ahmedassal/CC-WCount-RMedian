#Insight Data Engineering Coding Challenge 
##Scalable Wordcount and Running Median



###Results
####Development IDE
JetBrains' PyCharm 4.0.5
####Computing Platform
The implementation was tested on Intel® Core™2 Duo CPU E7500 @ 2.93GHz (Dual Core), 4 GB RAM, Intel G41 Built Display Card, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit.
####Test Data 
####Perfromance
#####Wordcount    
*The sequential implementation of my wordcount algorithm finished in about 3.15 seconds.    
*The multiprocessing implementation finished in about 1.15 second.     
*This enhancement in the performance is a factor of 2.74.
